Undergrads Capstone Project - DETECTION OF THREATS IN CLOUD DATA SHARING USING MACHINE LEARNING

The main objective of this project is:
- To study and analyze various methods used to detect and prevent the threats in cloud sharing.
- Compare, train and implement major machine learning algorithms, for accuracy, precision and recall and try to make modify the better one to aim for even higher accuracy.
- Try to come up with a reason as to why a certain model performed better than others.
- Implement various ML algorithms to see and compare their performances
